Monster RPG 3 is a JRPG by Nooskewl.

M3 depends on TGUI3 (GUI), Nooskewl Shim (low level improvements on SDL2) and
Nooskewl Wedge (JRPG engine.)

The fonts are not covered by the Monster RPG 3 license and should not be
reused.

All of the graphics in data/ have the palettes removed. You can load the
palette from data/gfx/palettes when you load a image and it will work (tested
only in Aseprite.)

One of my goals with Monster RPG 3 was to ship the smallest game I could.
Removing the palettes was one of many optimisations.
